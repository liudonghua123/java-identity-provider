    This file is an EXAMPLE configuration file. While the configuration
    presented in this example file is semi-functional, it isn't very
    interesting. It is here only as a starting point for your deployment
    process.
    
    Very few attribute definitions and data connectors are demonstrated,
    and the data is derived statically from the logged-in username and a
    static example connector.

    Attribute-resolver-full.xml contains more examples of attributes,
    encoders, and data connectors. Deployers should refer to the Shibboleth
    documentation for a complete list of components and their options.
